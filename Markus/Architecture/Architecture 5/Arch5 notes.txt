Architecture 5 Notes : 

- Additional file called Arch5_masterserver.py logs in the robots into the system and opens a single process for 
	each of the robots connected.
- The process created by this new file will time-out after 20 seconds of inactivity(robot not sending status updates)
	This is to prevent multiple processes per robot. 
- In the event of any problems, the only thing needed is to power cycle the robot itself. The server won't require
	user intervension. We could also implement a key sequence that would send the log-in signal again as to 
	remove the need to reboot affected robot. The 20 second delay may be modified in lenght as well, however this
	delay must pass before the robot is logged back into the server or else there will be duplicate processe for
	that robot.
- This file takes no arguments to run.
