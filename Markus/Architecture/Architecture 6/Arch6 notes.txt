Architecture 6 Notes : 

Commit 8/9/2016:
-General fixes.
-Robot name get automation. (complete log-in automation achieved using http:// server)
-Robot names are obtained by using the MAC eth0 or wlan0 of each robots.




to do:
-Files still local to rpi robot and rpi server, not downloaded from web server (future update)
-Ensure that the robots will still drive when the server goes down (when robot already logged in)
-One of the biggest flaw of the system is that if the robot is "stopped" by a command and the 
	server goes down. It will stay stopped until the server is back on and sends a "go" commands.
	We need to think of a way to deal with short down-times and long down-times.
