Architecture 3

Test 1

- Implement basic masterControl functions like start/stop/slow/fast/disable any motor.(message passing is implemented but not the commands themselves)
- Implement basic controller controls to send coded commands to robots depending on robot ID (if one robot) or
	broadcast to all (if start/stop)
- Add a request field that allows to request a status update from all or just one robot.(controller side done, not robot side)

-masterControl database and control script only sends commands if there is a change in the database fields.
-Can select to send to all robots (ID field = 60) or to specific robots (ID field = 1 to 16)

- Control commands can be listed in the masterControl table in advance. the report field acts as a select signal
	to select which command (row) is active as the current robot control command. This can enable two special
	function (like rfid speed up etc). It can desable auxilary motors from one or all robots. It can stop/start
	one or all robots. It can also request a status update from one or all robots. (for request. keep all fields
	except report as NULL (empty) and set the request field to "1". (communication basis is implemented on db/controller
	but not on robot side.


Test 2


- Just get basic communication channels working first : like changing masterControl database to start/stop all 
	robots. (now working 7/28/16) with no stutter !!
-- Implement PS3 client functions to decode commands and execute them. (go/stop)

- Implement robot side for all of test 1 controller implementations. 

** This will be done at a later time.
- Implement a scoreboard script to  be run from the server. This reads and writes to masterController AND status.
