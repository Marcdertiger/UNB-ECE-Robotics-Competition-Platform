- 8/3/2016 - Commit has WIP files for Architecture 4. 

8/4/16:

- Steamline set-up process for users by creating log-in process between PS3client and server_client.
- Now only need to provide IP address of the server to the robot script by passing a system variable when
	executing the script.
- Layed out cautionary actions to prevent ducplicated rows in status database.
- Layed out cautionary actions to prevent duplicate processes for the same robot when the future server_client_creator script
	will be added.

server_client_creator: This script will open a single server_client script per robot to enable communication.
	This script should take ownership of the sign-in process on the server side.
