So far, using jesse lite with a class 10 card and mySQL seems to offer
the best performance to add large amounts of data on a database.

Next: Test single line reads, single line removal.

Removing lines with ie: name = 'Monster' when db has 500+ lines with
all names are 'Monster'. The delete happens extremely fast on either systems.

Performance of finding a line and removing it is similar on both fullOS
and liteOS on mySQL.

After testing read speeds on class 10,4 and gui/lite OS, all seem to perform rapidly. 

Some research has yeilded a regrettable remark: sqlite is not typically recommended for remote database access.
Insert speeds on sqlite are also slower than mysql, this seems to be a widespread issue with the system.

I will not disregard sqlite this quickly however the above remarks should be strongly considered.
